# # ===============================================================
#--after-context=1
--follow

# --before-context <NUM>
# Show NUM lines before each match.

# -f, --file <PATTERNFILE>...
# Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line. When this
# flag is used multiple times or in combination with the -e/--regexp flag,
# then all patterns provided are searched. Empty pattern lines will match all
# input lines, and the newline is not counted as part of the pattern.
#
# A line is printed if and only if it matches at least one of the patterns.
# --files
# Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the search.
# This is useful to determine whether a particular file is being searched or not.
# -l, --files-with-matches
# Print the paths with at least one match and suppress match contents.
#

# -g, --glob <GLOB>...
# --glob-case-insensitive
#
# --heading
# This flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file instead
# of printing the file path as a prefix for each matched line. This is the
# default mode when printing to a terminal.
#
# This overrides the --no-heading flag.
# -., --hidden
# Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories
# are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an
# ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.
#
# A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot
# character ('.'). On operating systems which support a `hidden` file attribute,
# like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered hidden.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.
# --iglob <GLOB>...
# Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given
# glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be
# used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude
# it. Globs are matched case insensitively.
# -i, --ignore-case
# When this flag is provided, the given patterns will be searched case
# insensitively. The case insensitivity rules used by ripgrep conform to
# Unicode's "simple" case folding rules.
#
# This flag overrides -s/--case-sensitive and -S/--smart-case.
# --ignore-file <PATH>...
# Specifies a path to one or more .gitignore format rules files. These patterns
# are applied after the patterns found in .gitignore and .ignore are applied
# and are matched relative to the current working directory. Multiple additional
# ignore files can be specified by using the --ignore-file flag several times.
# When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier files have lower precedence
# than later files.
#
# If you are looking for a way to include or exclude files and directories
# directly on the command line, then used -g instead.
# --ignore-file-case-insensitive
# Process ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) case insensitively. Note that
# this comes with a performance penalty and is most useful on case insensitive
# file systems (such as Windows).
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --no-ignore-file-case-insensitive flag.
# --include-zero
# When used with --count or --count-matches, print the number of matches for
# each file even if there were zero matches. This is disabled by default but can
# be enabled to make ripgrep behave more like grep.
# -v, --invert-match
# Invert matching. Show lines that do not match the given patterns.
#
# --files-with-matches, --files-without-match, --count or --count-matches.
# ripgrep will report an error if any of the aforementioned flags are used in
# concert with --json.
#
# Other flags that control aspects of the standard output such as
# --only-matching, --heading, --replace, --max-columns, etc., have no effect
# when --json is set.
#
# A more complete description of the JSON format used can be found here:
# https://docs.rs/grep-printer/*/grep_printer/struct.JSON.html
#
# The JSON Lines format can be disabled with --no-json.
# --line-buffered
# When enabled, ripgrep will use line buffering. That is, whenever a matching
# line is found, it will be flushed to stdout immediately. This is the default
# when ripgrep's stdout is connected to a terminal, but otherwise, ripgrep will
# use block buffering, which is typically faster. This flag forces ripgrep to
# use line buffering even if it would otherwise use block buffering. This is
# typically useful in shell pipelines, e.g.,
# 'tail -f something.log | rg foo --line-buffered | rg bar'.
#
# Forceful line buffering can be disabled with --no-line-buffered. Note that
# using --no-line-buffered causes ripgrep to revert to its default behavior of
# automatically detecting the buffering strategy. To force block buffering, use
# the --block-buffered flag.
# -n, --line-number
# Show line numbers (1-based). This is enabled by default when searching in a
# terminal.
#
# -x, --line-regexp
# Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries. This is equivalent to putting
# ^...$ around all of the search patterns. In other words, this only prints lines
# where the entire line participates in a match.
#
# This overrides the --word-regexp flag.
# -M, --max-columns <NUM>
# Don't print lines longer than this limit in bytes. Longer lines are omitted,
# and only the number of matches in that line is printed.
#
# When this flag is omitted or is set to 0, then it has no effect.
# --max-columns-preview
# When the '--max-columns' flag is used, ripgrep will by default completely
# replace any line that is too long with a message indicating that a matching
# line was removed. When this flag is combined with '--max-columns', a preview
# of the line (corresponding to the limit size) is shown instead, where the part
# of the line exceeding the limit is not shown.
#
# If the '--max-columns' flag is not set, then this has no effect.
#
# This flag can be disabled with '--no-max-columns-preview'.
# -m, --max-count <NUM>
# Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.
#
# --max-depth <NUM>
# Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths given. A
# value of zero only searches the explicitly given paths themselves.
#
# For example, 'rg --max-depth 0 dir/' is a no-op because dir/ will not be
# descended into. 'rg --max-depth 1 dir/' will search only the direct children of
# 'dir'.
# --max-filesize <NUM+SUFFIX?>
# Ignore files larger than NUM in size. This does not apply to directories.
#
# The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to kilobytes,
# megabytes and gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is provided the input is
# treated as bytes.
#
# Examples: --max-filesize 50K or --max-filesize 80M
# --mmap
# Search using memory maps when possible. This is enabled by default when ripgrep
# thinks it will be faster.
#
# Memory map searching doesn't currently support all options, so if an
# incompatible option (e.g., --context) is given with --mmap, then memory maps
# will not be used.
#
# Note that ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when --mmap if it searches a file that
# is simultaneously truncated.
#
# This flag overrides --no-mmap.
# -U, --multiline
# Enable matching across multiple lines.
#
# When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match
# cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not
# enabled (the default), then the regex '\p{any}' will match any Unicode
# codepoint other than '\n'. Similarly, the regex '\n' is explicitly forbidden,
# and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline
# mode is enabled, '\p{any}' will match any Unicode codepoint, including '\n',
# and regexes like '\n' are permitted.
#
# An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the match semantics
# of '.'. Namely, in most regex matchers, a '.' will by default match any
# character other than '\n', and this is true in ripgrep as well. In order to
# make '.' match '\n', you must enable the "dot all" flag inside the regex.
# For example, both '(?s).' and '(?s:.)' have the same semantics, where '.' will
# match any character, including '\n'. Alternatively, the '--multiline-dotall'
# flag may be passed to make the "dot all" behavior the default. This flag only
# applies when multiline search is enabled.
#
# There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can span.
#
# **WARNING**: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline
# searches may be slower than normal line-oriented searches, and they may also
# use more memory. In particular, when multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep
# requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in memory
# (either by reading it onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things that
# cannot be memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before
# searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these things when
# necessary. Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided but the regex
# does not contain patterns that would match '\n' characters, then ripgrep
# will automatically avoid reading each file into memory before searching it.
# Nevertheless, if you only care about matches spanning at most one line, then it
# is always better to disable multiline mode.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline.
# --multiline-dotall
# This flag enables "dot all" in your regex pattern, which causes '.' to match
# newlines when multiline searching is enabled. This flag has no effect if
# multiline searching isn't enabled with the --multiline flag.
#
# Normally, a '.' will match any character except newlines. While this behavior
# typically isn't relevant for line-oriented matching (since matches can span at
# most one line), this can be useful when searching with the -U/--multiline flag.
# By default, the multiline mode runs without this flag.
#
# This flag is generally intended to be used in an alias or your ripgrep config
# file if you prefer "dot all" semantics by default. Note that regardless of
# whether this flag is used, "dot all" semantics can still be controlled via
# inline flags in the regex pattern itself, e.g., '(?s:.)' always enables "dot
# all" whereas '(?-s:.)' always disables "dot all".
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline-dotall.
# --no-config
# Never read configuration files. When this flag is present, ripgrep will not
# respect the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
#
# If ripgrep ever grows a feature to automatically read configuration files in
# pre-defined locations, then this flag will also disable that behavior as well.
# -I, --no-filename
# Never print the file path with the matched lines. This is the default when
# ripgrep is explicitly instructed to search one file or stdin.
#
# This flag overrides --with-filename.
# --no-heading
# Don't group matches by each file. If --no-heading is provided in addition to
# the -H/--with-filename flag, then file paths will be printed as a prefix for
# every matched line. This is the default mode when not printing to a terminal.
#
# This overrides the --heading flag.
# --no-ignore
# Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.). This implies
# --no-ignore-dot, --no-ignore-exclude, --no-ignore-global, no-ignore-parent and
# --no-ignore-vcs.
#
# This does *not* imply --no-ignore-files, since --ignore-file is specified
# explicitly as a command line argument.
#
# When given only once, the -u flag is identical in behavior to --no-ignore and
# can be considered an alias. However, subsequent -u flags have additional
# effects; see --unrestricted.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore flag.
# --no-ignore-dot
# Don't respect .ignore files.
#
# This does *not* affect whether ripgrep will ignore files and directories
# whose names begin with a dot. For that, see the -./--hidden flag.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-dot flag.
# --no-ignore-exclude
# Don't respect ignore files that are manually configured for the repository
# such as git's '.git/info/exclude'.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-exclude flag.
# --no-ignore-files
# When set, any --ignore-file flags, even ones that come after this flag, are
# ignored.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-files flag.
# --no-ignore-global
# Don't respect ignore files that come from "global" sources such as git's
# `core.excludesFile` configuration option (which defaults to
# `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`).
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-global flag.
# --no-ignore-messages
# Suppresses all error messages related to parsing ignore files such as .ignore
# or .gitignore.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-messages flag.
# --no-ignore-parent
# Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent directories.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-parent flag.
# --no-ignore-vcs
# Don't respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This implies
# --no-ignore-parent for VCS files. Note that .ignore files will continue to be
# respected.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --ignore-vcs flag.
# -N, --no-line-number
# Suppress line numbers. This is enabled by default when not searching in a
# terminal.
#
# --no-messages
# Suppress all error messages related to opening and reading files. Error
# messages related to the syntax of the pattern given are still shown.
#
# This flag can be disabled with the --messages flag.
# --no-mmap
# Never use memory maps, even when they might be faster.
#
# This flag overrides --mmap.
#
# --no-pcre2-unicode
# DEPRECATED. Use --no-unicode instead.
#
# This flag is now an alias for --no-unicode. And --pcre2-unicode is an alias
# for --unicode.
# --no-require-git
# By default, ripgrep will only respect global gitignore rules, .gitignore rules
# and local exclude rules if ripgrep detects that you are searching inside a
# git repository. This flag allows you to relax this restriction such that
# ripgrep will respect all git related ignore rules regardless of whether you're
# searching in a git repository or not.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --require-git.
# --no-unicode
# By default, ripgrep will enable "Unicode mode" in all of its regexes. This
# has a number of consequences:
#
# * '.' will only match valid UTF-8 encoded scalar values.
# * Classes like '\w', '\s', '\d' are all Unicode aware and much bigger
# than their ASCII only versions.
# * Case insensitive matching will use Unicode case folding.
# * A large array of classes like '\p{Emoji}' are available.
# * Word boundaries ('\b' and '\B') use the Unicode definition of a word
# character.
#
# In some cases it can be desirable to turn these things off. The --no-unicode
# flag will do exactly that.
#
# For PCRE2 specifically, Unicode mode represents a critical trade off in the
# user experience of ripgrep. In particular, unlike the default regex engine,
# PCRE2 does not support the ability to search possibly invalid UTF-8 with
# Unicode features enabled. Instead, PCRE2 *requires* that everything it searches
# when Unicode mode is enabled is valid UTF-8. (Or valid UTF-16/UTF-32, but for
# the purposes of ripgrep, we only discuss UTF-8.) This means that if you have
# PCRE2's Unicode mode enabled and you attempt to search invalid UTF-8, then
# the search for that file will halt and print an error. For this reason, when
# PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, ripgrep will automatically "fix" invalid
# UTF-8 sequences by replacing them with the Unicode replacement codepoint. This
# penalty does not occur when using the default regex engine.
#
# If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2 when Unicode mode
# is enabled, then pass the --no-encoding flag to disable all transcoding.
#
# The --no-unicode flag can be disabled with --unicode. Note that
# --no-pcre2-unicode and --pcre2-unicode are aliases for --no-unicode and
# --unicode, respectively.
# -0, --null
# Whenever a file path is printed, follow it with a NUL byte. This includes
# printing file paths before matches, and when printing a list of matching files
# such as with --count, --files-with-matches and --files. This option is useful
# for use with xargs.
# --null-data
# Enabling this option causes ripgrep to use NUL as a line terminator instead of
# the default of '\n'.
#
# This is useful when searching large binary files that would otherwise have very
# long lines if '\n' were used as the line terminator. In particular, ripgrep
# requires that, at a minimum, each line must fit into memory. Using NUL instead
# can be a useful stopgap to keep memory requirements low and avoid OOM (out of
# memory) conditions.
#
# This is also useful for processing NUL delimited data, such as that emitted
# when using ripgrep's -0/--null flag or find's --print0 flag.
#
# Using this flag implies -a/--text.
# --one-file-system
# When enabled, ripgrep will not cross file system boundaries relative to where
# the search started from.
#
# Note that this applies to each path argument given to ripgrep. For example, in
# the command 'rg --one-file-system /foo/bar /quux/baz', ripgrep will search both
# '/foo/bar' and '/quux/baz' even if they are on different file systems, but will
# not cross a file system boundary when traversing each path's directory tree.
#
# This is similar to find's '-xdev' or '-mount' flag.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-one-file-system.
# -o, --only-matching
# Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such
# part on a separate output line.
# --passthru
# Print both matching and non-matching lines.
#
# Another way to achieve a similar effect is by modifying your pattern to match
# the empty string. For example, if you are searching using 'rg foo' then using
# 'rg "^|foo"' instead will emit every line in every file searched, but only
# occurrences of 'foo' will be highlighted. This flag enables the same behavior
# without needing to modify the pattern.
#
# This overrides the --context, --after-context and --before-context flags.
# --path-separator <SEPARATOR>
# Set the path separator to use when printing file paths. This defaults to your
# platform's path separator, which is / on Unix and \ on Windows. This flag is
# intended for overriding the default when the environment demands it (e.g.,
# cygwin). A path separator is limited to a single byte.
# -P, --pcre2
# When this flag is present, ripgrep will use the PCRE2 regex engine instead of
# its default regex engine.
#
# This is generally useful when you want to use features such as look-around
# or backreferences.
#
# Note that PCRE2 is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2 wasn't included in
# your build of ripgrep, then using this flag will result in ripgrep printing
# an error message and exiting. PCRE2 may also have worse user experience in
# some cases, since it has fewer introspection APIs than ripgrep's default regex
# engine. For example, if you use a '\n' in a PCRE2 regex without the
# '-U/--multiline' flag, then ripgrep will silently fail to match anything
# instead of reporting an error immediately (like it does with the default
# regex engine).
#
# Related flags: --no-pcre2-unicode
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-pcre2.
# --pcre2-version
# When this flag is present, ripgrep will print the version of PCRE2 in use,
# along with other information, and then exit. If PCRE2 is not available, then
# ripgrep will print an error message and exit with an error code.
# --pre <COMMAND>
# For each input FILE, search the standard output of COMMAND FILE rather than the
# contents of FILE. This option expects the COMMAND program to either be an
# absolute path or to be available in your PATH. Either an empty string COMMAND
# or the '--no-pre' flag will disable this behavior.
#
# WARNING: When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a
# process for every file that is searched. Therefore, this can incur an
# unnecessarily large performance penalty if you don't otherwise need the
# flexibility offered by this flag. One possible mitigation to this is to use
# the '--pre-glob' flag to limit which files a preprocessor is run with.
#
# A preprocessor is not run when ripgrep is searching stdin.
#
# When searching over sets of files that may require one of several decoders
# as preprocessors, COMMAND should be a wrapper program or script which first
# classifies FILE based on magic numbers/content or based on the FILE name and
# then dispatches to an appropriate preprocessor. Each COMMAND also has its
# standard input connected to FILE for convenience.
#
# For example, a shell script for COMMAND might look like:
#
# case "$1" in
# *.pdf)
# exec pdftotext "$1" -
# ;;
# *)
# case $(file "$1") in
# *Zstandard*)
# exec pzstd -cdq
# ;;
# *)
# exec cat
# ;;
# esac
# ;;
# esac
#
# The above script uses `pdftotext` to convert a PDF file to plain text. For
# all other files, the script uses the `file` utility to sniff the type of the
# file based on its contents. If it is a compressed file in the Zstandard format,
# then `pzstd` is used to decompress the contents to stdout.
#
# This overrides the -z/--search-zip flag.
# --pre-glob <GLOB>...
# This flag works in conjunction with the --pre flag. Namely, when one or more
# --pre-glob flags are given, then only files that match the given set of globs
# will be handed to the command specified by the --pre flag. Any non-matching
# files will be searched without using the preprocessor command.
#
# This flag is useful when searching many files with the --pre flag. Namely,
# it permits the ability to avoid process overhead for files that don't need
# preprocessing. For example, given the following shell script, 'pre-pdftotext':
#
# #!/bin/sh
#
# pdftotext "$1" -
#
# then it is possible to use '--pre pre-pdftotext --pre-glob '*.pdf'' to make
# it so ripgrep only executes the 'pre-pdftotext' command on files with a '.pdf'
# extension.
#
# Multiple --pre-glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it.
#
# This flag has no effect if the --pre flag is not used.
# -p, --pretty
# This is a convenience alias for '--color always --heading --line-number'. This
# flag is useful when you still want pretty output even if you're piping ripgrep
# to another program or file. For example: 'rg -p foo | less -R'.
# -q, --quiet
# Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file, then ripgrep
# will stop searching. This is useful when ripgrep is used only for its exit
# code (which will be an error if no matches are found).
#
# When --files is used, then ripgrep will stop finding files after finding the
# first file that matches all ignore rules.
# --regex-size-limit <NUM+SUFFIX?>
# The upper size limit of the compiled regex. The default limit is 10M.
#
# The argument accepts the same size suffixes as allowed in the --max-filesize
# flag.
# -e, --regexp <PATTERN>...
# A pattern to search for. This option can be provided multiple times, where
# all patterns given are searched. Lines matching at least one of the provided
# patterns are printed. This flag can also be used when searching for patterns
# that start with a dash.
#
# For example, to search for the literal '-foo', you can use this flag:
#
# rg -e -foo
#
# You can also use the special '--' delimiter to indicate that no more flags
# will be provided. Namely, the following is equivalent to the above:
#
# rg -- -foo
# -r, --replace <REPLACEMENT_TEXT>
# Replace every match with the text given when printing results. Neither this
# flag nor any other ripgrep flag will modify your files.
#
# Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported in the
# replacement string. Capture group indices are numbered based on the position of
# the opening parenthesis of the group, where the leftmost such group is $1. The
# special $0 group corresponds to the entire match.
#
# In shells such as Bash and zsh, you should wrap the pattern in single quotes
# instead of double quotes. Otherwise, capture group indices will be replaced by
# expanded shell variables which will most likely be empty.
#
# To write a literal '$', use '$$'.
#
# Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and NOT the entire
# line. To replace the entire line, you should match the entire line.
#
# This flag can be used with the -o/--only-matching flag.
# -z, --search-zip
# Search in compressed files. Currently gzip, bzip2, xz, LZ4, LZMA, Brotli and
# Zstd files are supported. This option expects the decompression binaries to be
# available in your PATH.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-search-zip.
# -S, --smart-case
# Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case
# sensitively otherwise.
#
# A pattern is considered all lowercase if both of the following rules hold:
#
# First, the pattern contains at least one literal character. For example, 'a\w'
# contains a literal ('a') but just '\w' does not.
#
# Second, of the literals in the pattern, none of them are considered to be
# uppercase according to Unicode. For example, 'foo\pL' has no uppercase
# literals but 'Foo\pL' does.
#
# This overrides the -s/--case-sensitive and -i/--ignore-case flags.
# --sort <SORTBY>
# This flag enables sorting of results in ascending order. The possible values
# for this flag are:
#
# none (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.
# path Sort by file path. Always single-threaded.
# modified Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always single-threaded.
# accessed Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always single-threaded.
# created Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.
#
# If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available on your
# system (for example, creation time is not available on ext4 file systems), then
# ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print an error and exit without searching.
#
# To sort results in reverse or descending order, use the --sortr flag. Also,
# this flag overrides --sortr.
#
# Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon
# parallelism and run in a single thread.
# --sortr <SORTBY>
# This flag enables sorting of results in descending order. The possible values
# for this flag are:
#
# none (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.
# path Sort by file path. Always single-threaded.
# modified Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always single-threaded.
# accessed Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always single-threaded.
# created Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.
#
# If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available on your
# system (for example, creation time is not available on ext4 file systems), then
# ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print an error and exit without searching.
#
# To sort results in ascending order, use the --sort flag. Also, this flag
# overrides --sort.
#
# Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon
# parallelism and run in a single thread.
# --stats
# Print aggregate statistics about this ripgrep search. When this flag is
# present, ripgrep will print the following stats to stdout at the end of the
# search: number of matched lines, number of files with matches, number of files
# searched, and the time taken for the entire search to complete.
#
# This set of aggregate statistics may expand over time.
#
# Note that this flag has no effect if --files, --files-with-matches or
# --files-without-match is passed.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-stats.
# -a, --text
# Search binary files as if they were text. When this flag is present, ripgrep's
# binary file detection is disabled. This means that when a binary file is
# searched, its contents may be printed if there is a match. This may cause
# escape codes to be printed that alter the behavior of your terminal.
#
# When binary file detection is enabled it is imperfect. In general, it uses
# a simple heuristic. If a NUL byte is seen during search, then the file is
# considered binary and search stops (unless this flag is present).
# Alternatively, if the '--binary' flag is used, then ripgrep will only quit
# when it sees a NUL byte after it sees a match (or searches the entire file).
#
# This flag can be disabled with '--no-text'. It overrides the '--binary' flag.
# -j, --threads <NUM>
# The approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0 (which is the default)
# causes ripgrep to choose the thread count using heuristics.
# --trim
# When set, all ASCII whitespace at the beginning of each line printed will be
# trimmed.
#
# This flag can be disabled with --no-trim.
# -t, --type <TYPE>...
# Only search files matching TYPE. Multiple type flags may be provided. Use the
# --type-list flag to list all available types.
#
# This flag supports the special value 'all', which will behave as if --type
# was provided for every file type supported by ripgrep (including any custom
# file types). The end result is that '--type all' causes ripgrep to search in
# "whitelist" mode, where it will only search files it recognizes via its type
# definitions.
# --type-add <TYPE_SPEC>...
# Add a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at a
# time. Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless --type-clear is used,
# globs are added to any existing globs defined inside of ripgrep.
#
# Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are
# NOT persisted. See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.
#
# Example:
#
# rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo' -tfoo PATTERN.
#
# --type-add can also be used to include rules from other types with the special
# include directive. The include directive permits specifying one or more other
# type names (separated by a comma) that have been defined and its rules will
# automatically be imported into the type specified. For example, to create a
# type called src that matches C++, Python and Markdown files, one can use:
#
# --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'
#
# Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using the
# --type-add flag again:
#
# --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'
#
# Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers.
# Punctuation characters are not allowed.
# --type-clear <TYPE>...
# Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE. This only clears the
# default type definitions that are found inside of ripgrep.
#
# Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are
# NOT persisted. See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.
# --type-list
# Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs.
#
# -T, --type-not <TYPE>...
# Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple type-not flags may be provided. Use
# the --type-list flag to list all available types.
# -u, --unrestricted
# Reduce the level of "smart" searching. A single -u won't respect .gitignore
# (etc.) files (--no-ignore). Two -u flags will additionally search hidden files
# and directories (-./--hidden). Three -u flags will additionally search binary
# files (--binary).
#
# 'rg -uuu' is roughly equivalent to 'grep -r'.
# -V, --version
# Prints version information
#
# --vimgrep
# Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers and
# column numbers. With this option, a line with more than one match will be
# printed more than once.
# -H, --with-filename
# Display the file path for matches. This is the default when more than one
# file is searched. If --heading is enabled (the default when printing to a
# terminal), the file path will be shown above clusters of matches from each
# file; otherwise, the file name will be shown as a prefix for each matched line.
#
# This flag overrides --no-filename.
# -w, --word-regexp
# Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is roughly equivalent to
# putting \b before and after all of the search patterns.
#
# This overrides the --line-regexp flag.
# Set line number color to color190, and match colors to background color161, foreground color016, italic.
# Line number color
--colors=line:fg:190
# Matched text colors and style
--colors=match:fg:16
--colors=match:bg:161
--colors=match:style:intense
